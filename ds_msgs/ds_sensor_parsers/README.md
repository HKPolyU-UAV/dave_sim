# Seapath Binary 11 format

This doesn't appear to work, nor does it appear to have ever worked.  The PHINS manual notes that
the format is big-endian, but there aren't any endian conversion calls in the source.  Between that
and broken tests, this is listed as "further work required to ressurect" during the 18.04 / melodic upgrade.
